	“Wordle” Final Project
Due Date: June 5th, 2023

Summary:
My final project for my AP Computer Science A class is based around the letter game, Wordle. A user randomly inputs 5 letter words to obtain clues about letters’ positioning to eventually figure out the entire word. 
Objectives:
I wanted to clearly outline to the user where the letters are (Green for a letter in the correct position, Yellow for a letter that is not in the correct position, and Red/X for a letter not in the word) for the best visual clarity
I utilized a while loop effectively to allow the user to stop at any time or continue playing for the best user experience
Methodology:
I created a large array of words and used a random number to choose a different word every time so that the user will not receive the same target word many times.
I expect the code to run like a regular wordle game by eliminating the unnecessary letters from an ArrayList of letters, and have a counter to ensure that the user must answer within 6 guesses or the mystery word will be revealed.
I personally think my project has simplicity but good reward once fully engaged into the Wordle game. The instructions and directions in the game are easy for any new or unfamiliar players to understand to start playing. 
Overall, I like how my project turned out, even if it slightly deviated from my original direction.

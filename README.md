# Final-Project
	“Wordle” Final Project
Due Date: June 5th, 2023

Summary:
My final project will be based around the letter game, Wordle. A user randomly inputs 5 letter words to obtain clues about letters’ positioning to eventually figure out the entire word. 
Objectives:
Clearly outline to the user where the letters are (Green for a letter in the correct position, Yellow for a letter that is not in the correct position, and Red/X for a letter not in the word) for the best visual clarity
Utilize a while loop effectively to allow the user to stop at any time or continue playing for the best user experience
Methodology:
I will plan to have a large array of words and use a random number to choose a different word every time so that the user will not receive the same target word many times. 
It may be necessary to use a different programming language to use a graphical user interface for the guesses to be displayed on the screen well. Or, I will have to learn to use Java in a different way to show what is going on in my code.
I expect the code to run like a regular wordle game by eliminating the unnecessary letters from an ArrayList of letters, and have a counter to ensure that the user must answer within 6 guesses or the mystery word will be revealed.
